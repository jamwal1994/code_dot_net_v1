Comment from author:
I created two CRUD projects one using ASP.NET and SQL server and another one with ASP.NET core with MVC and entity framework.
First I built it with Asp.net using sql server but got an error while creating a view for the same. Then I rewrote the code again using ASP.NET Core. 
Here is the final output you can check and share your feedback accordingly.
